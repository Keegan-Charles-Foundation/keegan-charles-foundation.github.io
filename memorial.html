    <p>Keegan Charles Smith was born on August 24, 2004. <br />
Keegan was an athlete and performer at heart, his heart was set on becoming an
MMA fighter. He had the talent and the determination; he could have made it.
Keegan had a sense of humor that was subtle but wicked. He had nicknames for
everyone in his family, including his beloved pets. He had a taste for the finer
things in life: sushi, crab, dry-aged prime rib. While he had no intention of wasting
time on something that didn't hold his interest, he would quickly master anything
that did. He was an incredible guitar player, singer, and had just started
longboarding. <br />
Keegan’s name fit well — Keegan for fiery one and Charles for warrior.
Underneath a tough and frequently guarded exterior was an incredibly tender-
hearted young man who struggled to express those big feelings. He was an avid
supporter of the underdog to the point that it got him in trouble on many
occasions. When recently asked what his ideal day would look like, his top answer
was, "I would donate some money to charity." He dreamed of using future
competition winnings to support the less fortunate and champion justice.<br />
The impact Keegan’s spirit made and continues to make is immeasurable.</p>
